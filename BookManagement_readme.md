Features

Design Decisions or Assumptions
•	Book Title Uniqueness: The system assumes that book titles are unique to simplify operations like adding and removing books.
•	In-Memory Storage: The current implementation stores all data in memory, meaning the data will be lost once the application is closed.
•	Simple Search: The search functionality is based on a simple string match for book titles and authors.
